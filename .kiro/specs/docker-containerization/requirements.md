# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the Shelly Lightbulb REST API Simulator to be packaged and distributed as Docker containers via Docker Hub. The solution will provide both a multi-stage build approach for production deployment and a docker-compose setup for local development. Users will be able to pull and run the complete application stack with a single command, making it easy to share, deploy, and run the simulator in any Docker-compatible environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build Docker images for both the backend and frontend, so that I can package the application for distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the backend THEN the system SHALL create a Docker image using a multi-stage build with Gradle and JDK 21
2. WHEN building the frontend THEN the system SHALL create a Docker image using Node.js for build and nginx for serving static files
3. WHEN building images THEN the system SHALL optimize layer caching to minimize build times
4. IF the build succeeds THEN the images SHALL be tagged with version numbers and 'latest' tag
5. WHEN running the backend container THEN it SHALL expose port 8080
6. WHEN running the frontend container THEN it SHALL expose port 80

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to run the entire application stack with docker-compose, so that I can quickly start the simulator without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing docker-compose up THEN the system SHALL start both backend and frontend containers
2. WHEN containers start THEN the backend SHALL be accessible at localhost:8080
3. WHEN containers start THEN the frontend SHALL be accessible at localhost:3000
4. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN requests SHALL be properly routed to the backend container
5. IF either container fails THEN docker-compose SHALL report the error and allow restart
6. WHEN executing docker-compose down THEN the system SHALL cleanly stop and remove all containers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to push Docker images to Docker Hub, so that others can easily pull and run the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pushing images THEN the system SHALL tag images with the Docker Hub repository name
2. WHEN pushing images THEN the system SHALL support both version-specific and 'latest' tags
3. IF authentication is required THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for Docker Hub login
4. WHEN images are pushed THEN they SHALL be publicly accessible on Docker Hub
5. WHEN pulling images THEN users SHALL be able to use standard docker pull commands

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear documentation on how to build, run, and deploy the Docker containers, so that I can use the containerized application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading documentation THEN it SHALL include instructions for building images locally
2. WHEN reading documentation THEN it SHALL include instructions for running with docker-compose
3. WHEN reading documentation THEN it SHALL include instructions for pulling from Docker Hub
4. WHEN reading documentation THEN it SHALL include environment variable configuration options
5. IF troubleshooting is needed THEN documentation SHALL include common issues and solutions
6. WHEN deploying to production THEN documentation SHALL include best practices and security considerations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Docker setup to support both development and production modes, so that I can use the same containerization approach across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading for code changes
2. WHEN running in production mode THEN the system SHALL use optimized builds with minimal image sizes
3. IF environment variables are provided THEN the containers SHALL use them to override default configurations
4. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL clearly document the differences
5. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL follow security best practices (non-root users, minimal base images)
